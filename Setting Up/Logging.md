**PS1**
To display the date and time, we can replace the `PS1` variable in our `.bashrc`  file with the following content.

One option for naming logs: `<date>-<start time>-<name>.log`.

**Linux**
`script 03-21-2021-0200-exploitation.log`

**Windows**
`Start-Transcript -Path "C:\Pentesting\03-21-2021-0200pm-exploitation.log"`

Potential PenTest Distros
Parrot OS, Kali Linux, BlackArch, BackBox
People seem to really like Kali since it includes almost all the tools u would need. Parrot seems decent too because it is light.
