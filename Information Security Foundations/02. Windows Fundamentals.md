# Introduction to Windows

## The Windows Operating System
Microsoft first introduced the Windows operating system on November 20, 1985. Over the years, there have been many different OSs released under the umbrella term of windows with subsequently many versions to each one of them. 

As new versions of Windows are introduced, older versions are deprecated and no longer receive Microsoft updates (unless a long-term support contract is purchased in some cases). Windows Server 2008 and 2012 reached end of life for security updates on January 14, 2020. Currently, only Server 2012 R2 and later are in support. However, Microsoft has released out-of-band patches for earlier versions of Windows in the past few years due to the discovery of the critical SMBv1 vulnerability (EternalBlue).

Many versions of Windows are now deemed "legacy" and are no longer supported. Organizations often find themselves running various older operating systems to support critical applications or due to operational or budgetary concerns. An assessor needs to understand the differences between versions and the various misconfigurations and vulnerabilities inherent to each.
## Windows Versions
The following is a list of the major Windows operating systems and associated version numbers:

|Operating System Names|Version Number|
|---|---|
|Windows NT 4|4.0|
|Windows 2000|5.0|
|Windows XP|5.1|
|Windows Server 2003, 2003 R2|5.2|
|Windows Vista, Server 2008|6.0|
|Windows 7, Server 2008 R2|6.1|
|Windows 8, Server 2012|6.2|
|Windows 8.1, Server 2012 R2|6.3|
|Windows 10, Server 2016, Server 2019|10.0|

We can use the [Get-WmiObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject?view=powershell-5.1) [cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-overview?view=powershell-7) to find information about the operating system. This cmdlet can be used to get instances of WMI classes or information about available WMI classes. Some useful classes are:

| Class                 | Description                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| win32_OperatingSystem | Information about the Windows version and build number. |
| Win32_Process         | Gives a process listing.                                |
| Win32_Service         | Gives a listing of services.                            |
| Win32_Bios            | Information about Basic Input/Output System(`BIOS`).    |
| ComputerName          | Parameter to get information about remote computers.    |
## Accessing Windows
### Local Access
Local access is the most common way to access any computer, including computers running Windows. `Input` is likely happening through a keyboard, trackpad &/or mouse. `Output` is coming from the display screen(s).
### Remote Access
Some of the most common remote access technologies include but aren't limited to:
- Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
- Secure Shell (SSH)
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
- Windows Remote Management (or PowerShell Remoting) (WinRM)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
We will focus primarily on using RDP in this module.
### Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
RDP uses a client/server architecture where a client-side application is used to specify a computer's target IP address or hostname over a network where RDP access is enabled. The target computer where RDP remote access is enabled is considered the server. It is important to note that RDP listens by default on logical port `3389`. We can use RDP to connect to a Windows target from an attack host running Linux or Windows. 

If we are connecting to a Windows target from a Windows host, we can use the built-in RDP client application called `Remote Desktop Connection` ([mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc)). For this to work, remote access must already be [allowed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-allow-access) on the target Windows system. By default, remote access is not allowed on Windows operating systems. Remote Desktop Connection also allows us to save connection profiles. This is a common habit among IT admins because it makes connecting to remote systems more convenient. As pentesters, we can benefit from looking for these saved Remote Desktop Files (`.rdp`) while on an engagement.
#### Using xfreerdp
From a Linux-based attack host we can use a tool called [xfreerdp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xfreerdp) to remotely access Windows targets. There are several options available to us with xfreerdp, such as drive redirection to be able to transfer files to/from the target host, which are worth practicing and we will cover in other modules within HTB Academy. Other RDP clients exist, such as [Remmina](https://remmina.org/) and [rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org/). To connect to a Windows target using xfreerdp use the following command:
`xfreerdp /v:<targetIp> /u:<user> /p:<password>`

## Operating System Structure
In Windows operating systems, the root directory is <drive_letter>:\ (commonly C drive). The root directory (also known as the boot partition) is where the operating system is installed. Other physical and virtual drives are assigned other letters, for example, Data (E:). The directory structure of the boot partition is as follows:

| Directory                  | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Perflogs                   | Can hold Windows performance logs but is empty by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Program Files              | On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are installed here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Program Files (x86)        | 32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions of Windows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ProgramData                | This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for certain installed programs to run. This data is accessible by the program no matter what user is running it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Users                      | This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the system and contains the two folders Public and Default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Default                    | This is the default user profile template for all created users. Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on the Default profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Public                     | This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the network by default but requires a valid network account to access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| AppData                    | Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user subfolder (i.e., cliff.moore\AppData). Each of these folders contains three subfolders. The Roaming folder contains machine-independent data that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries. The Local folder is specific to the computer itself and is never synchronized across the network. LocalLow is similar to the Local folder, but it has a lower data integrity level. Therefore it can be used, for example, by a web browser set to protected or safe mode. |
| Windows                    | The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system are contained here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| System, System32, SysWOW64 | Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| WinSxS                     | The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
### Exploring Directories Using Command Line

| Command | Description                                                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dir     | Lists the files and folders in the given directory.                     |
| tree    | Graphically displays the directory structure of the given path or disk. |
## File System
There are 5 types of file system in windows: Fat12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS and exFAT. FAT12 and FAT16 are no longer used on modern Windows operating systems. FAT stands for File Allocation Table and the number in front represents the the number of bits used to identify data clusters. This section is mostly on NTFS but touches upon FAT32.
### FAT32
Pros of FAT32:
- Device compatibility. Can be used on computers, cameras, consoles, smartphones and more.
- Operating system cross-compatibility. Works on all Windows OS starting from Windows 95 and is supported by MacOS and Linux.
Cons of FAT32:
- Can only be used with files that are less than 4GB.
- No built-in data protection or compression features.
- Must use third party tool to encrypt.
### NTFS
NTFS stands for New Technology File System and is the default system for Windows OS since Windows NT 3.1.
Pros of NTFS:
- NTFS is reliable and can restore the consistency of the file in the event of a system failure or power loss.
- Provides security by allowing us to set granular permissions for files or folders.
- Supports very largely-sized partitions.
- Has journaling built-in, meaning that file modifications are logged.
- Better metadata support than FAT32
- Better performance than FAT32 due to improved data structuring.
Cons of NTFS:
- Most older devices do not support NTFS natively.
- Older media devices cannot support NTFS at all.
### Permissions 
The NTFS file system has many basic and advanced permissions. Some of the key ones are:

|Permission Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Full Control|Allows reading, writing, changing, deleting of files/folders.|
|Modify|Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.|
|List Folder Contents|Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.|
|Read and Execute|Allows for viewing and listing files and subfolders as well as executing files. Files and folders inherit this permission.|
|Write|Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing to a file.|
|Read|Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and viewing a file's contents.|
|Traverse Folder|This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach other files or folders. For example, a user may not have permission to list the directory contents or view files in the documents or web apps directory in this example c:\users\bsmith\documents\webapps\backups\backup_02042020.zip but with Traverse Folder permissions applied, they can access the backup archive.|
Files and folders inherit the permissions from their parent folder for ease of use. If permissions need to be set explicitly, inheritance can be manually disabled and new permissions set.
### Integrity Control Access Control List (`icacls`)
We can use `icacls` from within the current directory or against a directory not currently in, to list out the NTFS permissions. The resource access level is listed after each user. The basic access levels are:
- `F` : full access
- `D` :  delete access
- `N` :  no access
- `M` :  modify access
- `RX` :  read and execute access
- `R` :  read-only access
- `W` :  write-only access
The possible inheritance settings are:
- `(CI)`: container inherit
- `(OI)`: object inherit
- `(IO)`: inherit only
- `(NP)`: do not propagate inherit
- `(I)`: permission inherited from parent container

We can grant permissions using `icacls` as such: 
`icacls <directory> /grant <user>:<permission>`
To revoke we replace grant with remove.
A full listing of `icacls` command-line arguments and detailed permission settings can be found [here](https://ss64.com/nt/icacls.html).
## NTFS vs. Share Permissions
The Server Message Block Protocol (`SMB`) is used in Windows to connect shared resources like files and printers. The following picture showcases this:
